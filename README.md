Hello!

I am a Health Informatics Masters student at MTU. I got my Bachelors degree in Human Biology and MSU! I love the Healtcare industry and working along side patients to help with their care. I hope in the future to work with Clinical Trials with Oncology patients to help give them the best change at life.

Within this portfolio i have just a few of the projects that i worked on in SAT 5424, I hope you enjoy!
