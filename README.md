Architecture Development Project

  This is a project that I worked on throughout the semester in parts adding on to each other to create 4 different Hospitals and one HIE through a virtual machine (VM). The goal was to create these hospitals and add in EHR systems to replicate the patients in those hospitals.

  The synthetic pateint data that was installed through Synthea was created for healthcare simulation, research, and testing purposes. In one of the parts of the project I made a simulation with COVD-19 sydromic surveillance disease outbreak and calculating those outcomes to show what the prejected disease outbreak would be.

  The next part of the project I had to install the Hapi-FHIR which is Fast Healthcare Interoperability Rsources which alows different healthcare systems to communite with each other and share the data that they have. This helps tremendously with reserch studies to help further the knowledge in healthcare.

  The challenges that I faced throughout this project were understanding the individual steps since not all of them were written out it was hard to follow some of the time. Also working with a completely new system that I have never used before was a challenge. These challenges also helped me to understand the difficulties working with EHRs and coordinating systems together.
