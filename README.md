# Final Project
  Improving Healthcare Quality and Costs through Health Informatics
  - There is a lot of current research about this emerging topic that can be a huge help to the healthcare industry.
  
  The quality of healthcare is decreasing because of mass amount of patients that need help and not enough doctors or time to treat them all. This is why Health informatics can be a huge help with imporiving the quality of care without increasing the cost for patients and providers.

  Opportunities moving forward-
    Implementing telehealth and at home monitoring cause reduce the cost of patients constantly having to come in for follow ups. The at home monitoring would deliver a high quality of care to patients in remote or underserved areas which can help with chronic disease monitoring, decrease unnecessary hospitalizations and emergeny department visits.

  Use of Artificial Inteligence- to help with resource allocation and preventive measures for disease outbreaks. Healthcare organizations can enhance their response capabilities to help save lives with AI through capacity planning, early detection and surveillance, and predictive modeling

Health Informatice is the future of healthcare, and above are just a few reasons why. Technology and AI can be a huge help in aiding the fast growing industry.
